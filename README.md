# Tic Tac Toe

This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate a solid understanding of modern web development concepts, including component-based architecture, unit testing, and the use of hooks.

## Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is structured into reusable and independent components, each with its own specific responsibility. This promotes a clean and maintainable codebase.
- **Unit Testing:** The project includes a suite of unit tests for components, hooks, and utility functions, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code.
- **Custom Hooks:** The game logic is encapsulated in a custom hook (`useBoard`), which separates the logic from the UI and allows for easy reuse.
- **TypeScript:** The use of TypeScript provides static typing, which helps to catch errors during development and improves the overall code quality.
- **Vite:** The project is set up with Vite, a modern and fast build tool that provides an excellent development experience.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- `src/components`: Contains the reusable React components.
- `src/hooks`: Contains the custom hooks.
- `src/utils`: Contains utility functions, constants, and type definitions.
- `src/views`: Contains the main views of the application.
